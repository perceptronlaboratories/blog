People around the world make billions of choices every second, subtly reshaping society—whether it's brewing coffee at home over Starbucks, joining a startup over a tech giant, or voting for one party over another. Each decision sets off a butterfly effect, influencing far more than meets the eye.

Traditionally, behaviorists—like economists and market researchers—rely on surveys and observations to predict reactions to events like interest rate hikes or product launches. However, these methods are often extremely near-sighted, capturing only the first layer of decision-making and a tiny fraction of the population.

*This is broken.*

We're trying to predict the future from the comfort of a couch. While most AI systems are built to reason about the world, we're going one step deeper—understanding the people who drive it. We want to tap directly into the decision-making engine of society, predicting the reactions and outcomes of the choices you make through simulations. But how exactly are we going to accomplish this?

### Our hypothesis

At Perceptron Labs, we're exploring this question: Can a single, unbiased model truly capture the complexity of human systems, or does it take a collaboration of specialized thinkers to see the full picture? In short, can multiple specialists outperform a generalist in predictive power?

**Our Strategy:** Not to create an all-knowing superintelligent AI, but to build models that better emulate the humans they’re designed to serve. Through their decision-making processes, biases, and imperfections, we hope these models will give us deeper and personal insights into the people that shape our world.

### Next 12 months

It's no simple task to get to this future. It’s going to take an unbelievably dedicated team and countless hours of research to get there, but first things first, here’s our plan:

1. Test our hypothesis on the power of *agentic* simulations with custom architecture and publish our findings with help from world-class professors, across the world and right here on our website.
2. Build the infrastructure on which simulations can be run.
3. Build products on top of our infrastructure to prove the feasibility in the market and show developers and researchers the applications of our technology.
4. **Find backing for our product to develop and train our own in-house models, specialized towards replicating individual decision-making tendencies and patterns.**

The road is challenging but clear. We’re pioneering a new way to predict human decision-making and its impact on the world. As a team of students, we’re learning along the way and have the right company structure in place to build the future together.
