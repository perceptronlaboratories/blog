At Perceptron, we're looking for fun ideas that we can run for our simulation technology and invite you to share your thoughts. If you're interested in the simulations we've already conducted or are currently running, feel free to check out our [whitepaper](https://www.perceptron.so/blog/sim-world-whitepaper).

### Simulation Ideas

Here are a few examples of simulations we've conceptualized. You can use these as inspiration to create your own ideas:

> ❓ **20 Questions:**  
> An agent is created to think of a person, place, or thing, while another agent asks questions to guess the item. The first agent responds with hints as the second one narrows down the options.

> ⚖️ **12 Angry Men:**  
> This simulation involves a courtroom jury where each juror has distinct motivations and personalities. The goal is to see how they work together or against each other to reach a verdict.

> 🏪 **Small Business:**  
> A small business enters a new area. Agents represent both the business and the local population, each with their financial situation and spending habits. The simulation tracks the business's growth and its economic impact on the community.

> 🤖 **Madlib:**  
> Use a Madlib template to create an agent with personality traits like funny or serious. The agent fills in the blanks, and you can react to the final narrative it generates.

> 🌍 **Global Warming:**  
> This simulation models the effects of environmental policies on businesses and carbon emissions. You can pass policies like carbon taxes, and agents representing businesses will adapt to or suffer under these new regulations, while carbon emissions are tracked over time.

### Come share your ideas!

We are creating a forum where anyone can post their simulation ideas. If you’d like to share your concept before then, feel free to email us at [ishaan@perceptron.so](mailto:ishaan@perceptron.so). We'd love to hear from you!
