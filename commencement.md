I'm excited to announce the official launch of our new artificial intelligence research organization, Perceptron Labs. Our mission is to redefine the future of prediction. Today marks the beginning of an ambitious journey as we aim to build a billion-dollar company at the forefront of simulation technology.

With initial funding in place, we’re gearing up to expand our team. We’re looking for talented individuals who are excited to push the boundaries of what's possible. If you're ready to contribute to cutting-edge technology and make a real impact with your work, email us at tanmai@perceptron.so.

Thank you for your support,  
Tanmai
