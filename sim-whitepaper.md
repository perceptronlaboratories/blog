### Overview

Welcome to *World*, the inaugural project in the *Sim* series. This research simulation is designed to dive into how decisions play out in different real-life situations. Think of it as a game that helps us understand complex dynamics by putting AI agents into various scenarios where they interact and make decisions that impact their environment.

### What we're hoping to learn

The main goal of *World* is to see how AI agents handle different situations and interact with each other and their environment. By looking at these interactions, we aim to learn how different actions influence the world around us. Currently, we are running the following simulations:

> 🏛️ [**Presidential Debate**](https://www.perceptron.so/sim/world):  
> A simulated debate featuring AI versions of Kamala Harris and Donald J. Trump, moderated by two AI moderators, engaging in realistic exchanges and responses.

> 🏈 **Live Sports Commentary:**  
> AI commentators provide real-time analysis and banter during a live football game feed, interacting as they would in a live broadcast.

> 🕵️ **Spyfall Game:**  
> Ten AI agents play Spyfall, a social deduction game, where they work to identify the spy among them through strategic questioning and interaction. If you don't know Spyfall, you can learn more [here](https://www.spyfall.app/gamerules).

> ❓ **Your idea of a simulation:**

### How we plan to do this

*World* is tackling this challenge using two exciting approaches:

1. **Enclosed Environments:** self-contained settings with diverse AI agents representing different human personas to study interactions within a controlled space.
2. **Open World Gameplay:** an expansive environment where human players can directly control AI agents' actions, allowing for dynamic and real-time interactions.

All findings and environments are coming soon — we're in the early stages of drafting a research paper and are starting design/development on a game open to the public.

### Expanding the team

We're growing our team and looking for talented individuals to help bring this vision to life. Explore our open roles to see how you can get involved.
